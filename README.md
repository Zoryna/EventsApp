# Campfire (EventsApp)

A Loyola University Chicago project for COMP 322, Software Development for Wireless and Mobile Devices. The project is a mobile app named Campfire.

## Purpose

Campfire is a mobile app where a user can meet other people in their local area
who are interested in attending the same events as them. It also allows users to meet
other people based on just their similar interests. The application allows a person to
create an account, find events in the area based on their interests, create an event to
organize meetups with other people who would want to attend, and it also helps users
find new interests and see who share the same interests and if those interests have
upcoming events. Campfire was designed in the hopes of connecting people locally
through finding others interested in the same activities to attend together or if users
simply want to connect just through shared interests.

## Tech

We used the mobile application development framework Apache Cordova to develop our app, and we used Android Studio for access to an emulator.

## Getting Started

To run the project, you must have Apache Cordova and Android Studio installed.

To install, Android Studio, the instructions can be found at https://developer.android.com/studio/. Then you must follow the instructions at https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds to choose an emulator.

To install Apache Cordova, the instructions can be found at https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/8.x/guide/platforms/android/index.html.

Once Apache Cordova and Android Studio are installed, you must connect them so you may run the project on an emulator. The instructions to connect Apache Cordova and Android Studio can also be found at https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/8.x/guide/platforms/android/index.html.

Our mobile app runs best on a Nexus 6P emulator with API 23.
