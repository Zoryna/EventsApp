# EventsApp
A mobile app where users can find other people who are interested in attending the same events in their area and who are interested in the same activities. The group members are Jeremy Aranguren, Nora Bonifas, Maria Gocal-Kappos, Linette Maliakal, and Janeen Soria. This app was created for our Software Development for Wireless and Mobile Devices course.
